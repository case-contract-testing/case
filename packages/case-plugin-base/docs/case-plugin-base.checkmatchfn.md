## CheckMatchFn type

Checks a matcher against some actual data and returns a Promise containing a MatchResult.

For checks beyond this matcher, use  to descend into any children.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type CheckMatchFn<T> = (matcher: T, matchContext: MatchContext, actual: unknown) => Promise<MatchResult> | MatchResult;
```
**References:** [MatchContext](./case-plugin-base.matchcontext.md)<!-- -->, [MatchResult](./case-plugin-base.matchresult.md)

## Remarks

This function must have no side effects. It may be called repeatedly on the same data by ContractCase during a run.

It must not modify the matcher descriptor during a run, but you may generate alternate matcher descriptors when you call the descend methods on the context.

Note that calling check and strip together must always return no errors:

```
yourMatcher.check(
  descriptor,
  context,
  yourMatcher.strip(descriptor)
) // must be a `MatchResult` with no errors
```
