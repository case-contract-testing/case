## TraversalFns.descendAndValidate property

Descend into the provided matcher, validating the expectations it was configured with. The top level is called before executing an Example to confirm that the example is sane.

Call this on any children of your matcher. If your matcher has more than one child, call this function multiple times and chain the promises together.

**Signature:**

```typescript
descendAndValidate: <T extends AnyCaseMatcherOrData>(matcherOrData: T, parentMatchContext: MatchContext) => Promise<void>;
```
