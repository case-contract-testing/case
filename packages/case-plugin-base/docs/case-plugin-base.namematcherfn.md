## NameMatcherFn type

Extracts the name for this matcher in an English, human readable format.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type NameMatcherFn<T> = (matcher: T, matchContext: MatchContext) => string;
```
**References:** [MatchContext](./case-plugin-base.matchcontext.md)

## Remarks

CAUTION: Any two matchers that produce the same string MUST have the exact same matching behaviour in all cases. The core relies on this property.

This function must have no side effects, it may be called repeatedly on the same data by ContractCase during a run.
