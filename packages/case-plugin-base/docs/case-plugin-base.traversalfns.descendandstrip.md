## TraversalFns.descendAndStrip property

Descend into the provided matcher, stripping the matchers from it so that just the raw data is returned.

The top level of this function can be called by users as a convenience. Additionally, it is called during the pre-validation step where ContractCase confirms that the example provided actually passes the matcher(s).

Call this on any children of your matcher. If your matcher has more than one child, call this function multiple times and combine the result appropriately.

**Signature:**

```typescript
descendAndStrip: (matcherOrData: AnyCaseMatcherOrData, parentMatchContext: MatchContext) => AnyData;
```
