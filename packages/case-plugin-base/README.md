This package provides the base implementation and types for implementing plugins for ContractCase.

Use it if you are extending ContractCase with new functionality. See also [case-plugin-dsl-types],(https://www.npmjs.com/package/@contract-case/case-plugin-dsl-types), which you'll need for building the DSL that users will use to describe Case Examples with your plugin types.
