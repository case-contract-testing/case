# Case Core Function Plugin DSL

[![Build and test](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

This is a ContractCase Core package. [Start here instead](https://case.contract-testing.io/docs/intro)

If you're looking to build on top of ContractCase, you probably want one of:

- `@contract-case/case-plugin-base`, for writing custom plugins that provide new mock types or new matchers
- `@contract-case/case-plugin-dsl-types`, for writing the definition DSL for your custom plugin
- `@contract-case/case-connector`, for writing wrappers for ContractCase in new languages
- `@contract-case/case-core`, if you want to contribute to the core behaviour
