## base.ContractCaseCoreBehaviour.mockType property

The type of this mock. Usually this is inverted on read vs write, for example, a written MOCK_HTTP_CLIENT might become a MOCK_HTTP_SERVER during reading.

This will almost always be the same as the top level type for your mock during read - but if it is different, ContractCase will respect this value.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly mockType: string;
```
