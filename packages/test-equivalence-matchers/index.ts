/**
 * The core ContractCase TestEquivalenceMatchers.

 * @remarks
 *
 * Use these to generalise your tests, avoiding the need to depend on specific
 * data during verification. It's not about defining the whole type system, the
 * idea is that you are saying "any message that matches this Test Equivalence
 * Matcher is considered covered by this test".
 *
 * For more information, see {@link https://case.contract-testing.io/docs/defining-contracts/relaxing-tests | the documentation here}
