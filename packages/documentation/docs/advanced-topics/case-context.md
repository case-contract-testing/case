# ContractCase Context

This document describes the context object, an internal implementation detail. You don't need to read it unless you are planning on extending ContractCase.

:::caution INCOMPLETE DOCUMENT

While ContractCase is in beta, some of the documentation is incomplete or bullet points only.

Each breaking change during the beta, one more document will be completed. If this notice is present in a document, it is not yet considered complete. If you are having trouble using Case or you would like a particular document prioritised, please [open an issue](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/issues/new)
