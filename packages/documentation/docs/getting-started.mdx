# Getting started

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import InstallJs from './examples/_install_js.mdx';
import InstallJava from './examples/_install_java.mdx';

First off, install the DSL package that's right for your language:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <InstallJs />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <InstallJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Contract testing lifecycle

Here's the lifecycle of a contract test:

1. Define a contract 
   1. Define examples
   1. Run tests to confirm the examples are correct
   1. Upload contracts to a broker
1. Verify the contract 
   1. Download contract from the broker
   1. Verify the contract
   1. Publish verification result to the broker

## Next steps

If you just want to jump in to some examples, you can have a read of:

* Typescript [client-driven contract definition](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/blob/main/packages/contract-case-jest/src/index.http.client.define.spec.ts)
* Typescript [client-driven contract verification](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/blob/main/packages/contract-case-jest/src/index.http.client.spec.verify.ts)
* Typescript [server-driven contract definition](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/blob/main/packages/contract-case-jest/src/index.http.server.define.spec.ts)
* Typescript [server-driven contract verification](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/blob/main/packages/contract-case-jest/src/index.http.server.spec.verify.ts)

If you're new to contract testing, have a read of [what is contract testing](./what-is-contract-testing/).

If you're defining a contract, [start here](./defining-contracts). If you're verifying an existing contract, [start here](./verifying-contracts).
