# ContractCase Contract Testing Suite

ContractCase is a next-generation consumer-driven contract testing framework, building
on many of the lessons from maintaining the excellent [Pact](https://pact.io) contract testing
framework.

## What is contract testing?

Contract testing builds deployment confidence by testing whether two services (eg an http client and an http server) are able to
communicate and understand each other.

If you've ever experienced downtime because of breaking API behaviours, then contract testing is for you.

* You can think of it as a unit test, where the "unit" is the communication code of the consumer and provider
* Or, you can think of it as integration tests that can run independently without the full stack
* Or you can think of it as a mock service, where your requests can be replayed later against the thing that you mocked

In our view, contract testing gives much faster and more actionable feedback than any of the [other approaches](./Alternatives).

By using real examples, contract testing is more than just a type checker - it
asserts that your providing service really does generate the responses you need in the
conditions you need it to. It is an ideal companion to generated APIs using Swagger, gRPC or
GraphQL, and very useful in microservice environments.

## Caveats and limitations

ContractCase is currently in beta. Feedback is extremely welcome and encouraged - 
please help us get to a stable release by trying out the framework, and [report
any issues](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/issues) you
experience.

During the beta, there are some caveats

1. ContractCase doesn't yet support merging of contracts. This means that your whole contract must be defined in one test file.
1. ContractCase currently only has rudimentary support for the contract broker. It works, but it's not very configurable yet - if you have a use case that isn't yet supported and you'd like it prioritised, please [open an issue](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/issues/new).
1. ContractCase is currently only available in JS/TS and Java. At a later date, support for Python, C# and Go will be added. 

Incomplete documentation is in the sidebar on your left (or at the bottom on
mobile). By way of apology for any breaking changes during the beta, at least
one new page of documentation will be added every time a breaking change is released during the
beta period.
