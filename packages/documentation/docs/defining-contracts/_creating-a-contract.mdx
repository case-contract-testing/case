ContractCase is [_consumer
driven_](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html),
meaning that we define the contract on the side of the communication boundary that consumes information.
Later, that contract is verified on the side of the communication boundary where information is provided.

This section describes how to write contracts, and details the lifecycle of an example
during contract definition. If you already have a contract,
and you want to know how to verify
it, you can skip to [contract verification](/docs/verifying-contracts).

## Which side is the consumer?

With message-based communication, it's clear which side should be the consumer - as the message sender
provides messages, and the message receiver consumes them.

However, with request/response pairs like HTTP and RPC calls, it's less clear.
Although some contract testing frameworks consider the client to always be the
consumer, technically in a request / response pair
like HTTP and RPC calls, either side could be considered the consumer:

- The client provides requests and consumes responses
- The server consumes requests and provides responses

Usually, it's best practice to consider the client as the consumer - as
the server exists in "service" of the client, so the communication is _for_ the client.
However, in some cases it might make sense to consider the server as the
consumer (for example, in remote logging frameworks, where the client side might
not even read the response).

:::tip Definition

The consumer is the side of the communication boundary that wants the result of the communication. Usually, this is the client.

ContractCase supports considering either the client or the server as the
consumer; if you are unsure, we recommend starting with your client as the consumer.

## What is in a contract?

In ContractCase, a contract is a series of examples, not a specification. Each example
is independent. To achieve this independence, any preconditions are handled by
state setup functions. This means each example contains:

- Each example contains:
  - Example Request (eg, an HTTP `GET` for `/users/12`)
  - Provider state (eg `"User 12 exists"`)
  - Example Response (eg, a `200 OK` response containing a `User` object as JSON)

A contract contains one or more of these examples.

## Creating a contract

You can begin contract definition with a `defineContract` call, which names the
consumer and provider pairs that this contract is for. Additional configuration
can be provided at this point, see [the configuration options reference](/docs/reference/configuring) for details.

For example, defining a contract might look like:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <CreatingJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <CreatingJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


In a contract, you can have as many `runExample` and `runRejectingExample`
calls as you like. When all the tests are over, you may need to tell ContractCase to write the contract to disk:


<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    ```
    // With Typescript/Javascript, there is no need 
    // to explictly write the contract as the
    // `defineContract` Jest DSL handles this for you
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <WritingJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
