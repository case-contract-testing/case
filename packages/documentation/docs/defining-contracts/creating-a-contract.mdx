# Creating a contract

Here's the contract testing lifecycle:

1. **Define a contract** (this section)

   1. Define examples
   1. Run tests to confirm the examples are correct
   1. Upload contracts to a broker

1. Verify the contract:
   1. Download contract from the broker
   1. Verify the contract
   1. Publish verification result to the broker

## To create a contract

In ContractCase, a contract starts with a `defineContract` call. This can be configured with a
`ContractCaseConfig` object (see [the configuration options reference
here](/docs/reference/configuring)).

For example, defining a contract might look like:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <CreatingJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <CreatingJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



In a contract, you can have as many `runExample` and `runRejectingExample`
calls as you like. When all the tests are over, ContractCase will write the contract to
disk (this is handle automatically by the `defineContract` DSL).

:::tip
If you are coming from other contract testing frameworks like Pact, be
aware that a Consumer is ContractCase is not always a synonym for "client", and
provider is not always a synonym for "server". For example, you
might be writing the contract on the server side, which means you are defining
the consumer of HTTP requests, not the consumer of responses.

Next, we will discuss the [ContractCase Example Lifecycle](./lifecycle).
