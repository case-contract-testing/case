# Defining a ContractCase Example

In ContractCase, a contract is a series of examples. Each example is independent - for
example: "a getUser request looks like $X, and a success response looks like $Y":


<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <Js />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <Java />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Examples should be independent

Instead of making examples dependent on each other (and the corresponding
explosion of complexity and potentially brittle tests), each contract definition
example runs independently. 

This is achieved with [state definitions](./defining-contracts/state-definitions) and [state setup
handlers](./reference/state-handlers), which you can use to set up any preconditions
that your example needs (for example, a user existing)
required by the `getUser` request first.

Any preconditions needed to set up the examples are handled with state - for
example: "when a user with ID 'foo' exists, a getUser request looks like $X, and
a success response looks like $Y":


<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <StateJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <StateJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


See the [state handlers](/docs/reference/state-handlers) section for more on state handlers.

## Overriding configuration

You can override the configuration for individual tests by providing an
optional `ContractCaseConfig` object as the final argument. See [the
configuration options reference](/docs/reference/configuring) for full details.
For example, here's how you could set the log level to debug for an individual
test:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="js" label="Typescript">
    <ConfigJs />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
   <ConfigJava />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Setting the log level to debug is a useful way to see what is happening during
the test, which can help you understand why an example might be failing.

## How do I tell ContractCase that a field is optional?

Instead of marking fields as optional, write two contract tests, one with the
field and one without. To provide the best deployment confidence, a contract
test needs specific examples, so there is no optional matcher.

This is because a test which allows optional fields could still pass even if the field
was never present. You wouldn't be sure that your provider could _ever_ generate
that missing field.

## Do I describe the whole API payload?

You only need to describe the parts of the API payload that your consumer relies on.

This is advantageous because it's not a breaking change to rename or remove a field/endpoint that
no-one is using. 

### Next steps

Next, set up your state [state definitions](./state-definitions).
