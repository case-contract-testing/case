# Configuring ContractCase

ContractCase accepts configuration parameters in the `defineContract` and `verifyContract` DSL functions.

This config can be overridden per-test or per-verification, by passing an
optional partial config object as the last parameter to `runExample`,
`runRejectingExample`, or `runVerification`. This is useful for overriding
specifics for different tests (eg, for increasing the log level on one specific test).

You can view the options as a filter - if an option is not specified in the test
run, it will look to the next layer. Here are the layers, from most to least
important:

1. Options specified in the test run (`runExample`, `runRejectingExample`, or `runVerification`).
1. Options specified at contract creation time (`defineContract` or `verifyContract`)
1. Environment variables (any option that can be a string or a boolean can be set with the environment variable `CASE_${optionName}`, for example `export CASE_logLevel=debug` or `export CASE_publish=false`)
1. Default options

## Required options

### `consumerName` \[string]

Default: None

This is the name of the service that [defined](/docs/defining-contracts) (or is
defining) the contract. Required by `defineContract`, not required by
`verifyContract`. If you specify it during `verifyContract`, then only contracts
from that consuming service will be verified.

:::tip note
It is an error to specify a different value of `consumerName` in `defineContract` and `runExample` / `runRejectingExample`.
:::

### `providerName` \[string]

Default: None

This is the name of the service that will verify the contract (or is verifying
the contract). Required by both `defineContract` and `verifyContract`

During `verifyContract`, the provider name must match the name that was used
when the consumer defined the contract.

## Reporting options

### `logLevel` \["none" | "error" | "warn" | "debug" | "maintainerDebug"]

Default: `"warn"`

Controls the level of logging to standard out that ContractCase does during your tests. Each setting also includes the logs from the level above it - for example, setting it to `debug` will also print any warnings and errors.

- `"none"` - Print no logs (although results may still be printed - see `printResults`)
- `"error"` - Something has gone wrong during the execution of the test framework
- `"warn"` - It seems likely that there is a misconfiguration. For best-practice use of ContractCase, there should be no warnings.
- `"debug"` - Information to help users find out what is happening during their tests. Use this if you want to know why your tests are failing.
- `"maintainerDebug"` - debugging information for ContractCase maintainers. Most users probably won't need these, but it's helpful to provide logs at this level in a [bug report](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/issues/new).
- `"deepMaintainerDebug"` - like `maintainerDebug` but with much more verbose logging of matching and requests.

:::caution WARNING
Both maintainer debugging levels might print user secrets. Additionally, `debug`
does not do this by default, but it does log the contents of your contract.
Please make sure you sanitise any output from `debug` and below before posting publicly (such as in a bug report).
:::

### `printResults` \[boolean]

Default: `true`

Controls whether or not ContractCase should print the test results to standard out
during a run. Set to false if you prefer a quiet test run.

## Contract output options

### `contractDir` \[string]

Default: `${WORKING_DIRECTORY}/case-contracts/`

The directory where the contract will be written. If you provide this, ContractCase
will generate the filename for you (unless `contractFilename` is specified,
in which case this setting is ignored).

ContractCase will not overwrite an existing file, so it's best to clear this directory at the start of a run.

### `contractFilename` \[string]

Default: Generated by ContractCase during a run.

The filename where the contract will be written. If you
provide this, `contractDir` is ignored.

ContractCase will not overwrite an existing file, so it's best to remove this file at the start of a run.

## Broker options

These options control how ContractCase contacts the contract broker.

### `brokerBaseUrl` \[string]

Default: None

The base URL for the contract broker. Required if `publish` is set to `true`, required in CI if `publish` is set to `ONLY_IN_CI`.

### `brokerBasicAuth` \[`{ username: string, password: string }`\]

Default: None

The basic auth to use when contacting the contract broker. If you're using a
`brokerCiAccessToken`, this option is ignored. Expects an object with the following structure:

```ts
{
  /**
   * The username for basic auth
   */
  username: string;
  /**
   * The password for basic auth
   */
  password: string;
}
```

### `brokerCiAccessToken` \[string]

Default: None

The access token to use for the contract broker. To publish contracts and
verification results, the token must have CI scope. Additionally, your broker
must support access tokens (currently, [pactflow](https://pactflow.io/) is the
only broker that supports access tokens).

If this is specified along with `brokerBasicAuth`, the basic auth is ignored.

### `publish` \[true | false | "ONLY_IN_CI" | "NEVER" | "ALWAYS"]

Default: `"ONLY_IN_CI"`

Whether to publish contracts or verification results to the broker. When set to:

- `"ONLY_IN_CI"` - ContractCase determines whether or not it is running inside a continuous integration build process, according to [`ci-info`](https://github.com/watson/ci-info#supported-ci-tools).
- `"NEVER" | false` - ContractCase does not publish any contracts or verification results to the broker.
- `"ALWAYS" | true` - ContractCase publishes contracts and verification results to the broker.

If `publish` is set, you must provide credentials and `brokerBaseUrl`. See above.

## Contract Testing configuration options

These options modify the behaviour of the contract testing engine. In general,
you should not need to change these defaults unless your use case is unusual.

### `throwOnFail` \[boolean];

Default: `true` during contract definition, `false` during contract verification.

Whether or not the test should throw an error if the matching fails.

During contract definition, the default is `true` to make sure that the test
suite fails. This is because a failure during contract definition means that the
service either didn't send the request that was defined in the test, or didn't
understand the response.

During contract verification, the default is `false`, because a contract
violation doesn't mean that the service doesn't work - it means that it is not
compatible with the consumer that wrote the contract. To get deployment confidence from ContractCase, you will need to use Can-I-Deploy checks - see the section on [deployment checks](/docs/deployment-checks)

:::tip NOTE
Any configuration errors will still fail the suite regardless of
this setting. This includes exceptions thrown during [trigger functions](./triggers), but
does not include exceptions thrown by [testResponse functions](./triggers).
:::

## Internal options

Most users probably won't need these, but they're documented here in case you are extending ContractCase or building tools on top of it.

### `testRunId` \[string]

Default: None (or provided by your test wrapper, eg Jest)

A unique identifier for this test. If you do not provide a `contractFilename`,
ContractCase uses this field as part of the generated filename, to prevent multiple
concurrent contract definitions from writing to the same file.
