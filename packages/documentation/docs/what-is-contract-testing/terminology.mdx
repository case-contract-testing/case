:::caution INCOMPLETE DOCUMENT

While ContractCase is in beta, some of the documentation is incomplete or bullet points only.

Each breaking change during the beta, one more document will be completed. If this notice is present in a document, it is not yet considered complete. If you are having trouble using ContractCase or you would like a particular document prioritised, please [open an issue](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/issues/new)

### Consumer

If you are coming from other contract testing frameworks like Pact, be
aware that a Consumer is ContractCase is not always a synonym for "client", and
provider is not always a synonym for "server". For example, you
might be writing the contract on the server side, which means you are defining
the consumer of HTTP requests, not the consumer of responses.


If your consumer is an HTTP client, contract definition means:
   - You define a series of request and response pairs, for different server
   states (for example, the same `getUser` request might result in different
   responses depending on whether or not the server exists)
   - Ensure that your client can actually send those defined requests
   - Ensure that your client can understand the responses you defined

In some rare cases, it might make sense for the server to be considered the consumer.

If your consumer is an HTTP server, contract definition means:
   - You define a series of request and response pairs, for different server
   states (for example, the same `getUser` request might result in different
   responses depending on whether or not the server exists)
   - Ensure that your server can actually understand those requests
   - Ensure that your servicer will actually send the responses you defined
